The installation should work smoothly.  The following problems have been observed:
* Your conda environment was not properly installed. It appears that `conda install` not always raises exceptions when there are download errors. Check your conda environment with the listings below. In China some channels are slow and you may want to use the tsinghua mirror (commented out lines in install_miniconda.csh). Did you use the proper channels for conda install? The channels should be taken care of by the .condarc but this has not been properly looked at.

* A problem occurrs at runtime using PBS. A typical explanation is that you don't have the same libraries on the compute nodes then on the head node (which is used for calcualtions). First run commands (without scheduler) on the head node and then try the same on a compute node (e.g. ssh node4).
